Dear GitHub team,

First off, thank you for taking the time to review my application, resume, and cover letter. I’m a huge fan of GitHub and open-source initiatives in general, so I’ve been browsing your job board for a while now. Every so often a role description comes along where you think “ah ha – this was made for me!”. Well, that’s how I felt with this role. I’ve worked as a Digital Marketing Manager for over six years now, so when I saw this opening for a Digital Marketing Manager at GitHub, I knew I had to apply.

Through an analytical approach, strong work ethic, and attention to detail, I have benefitted my current and past employers beyond their expectations, and I assure you I will do the same for GitHub.

After graduating from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in Marketing Management, I started my marketing career in e-commerce, and have since worked in SaaS, restaurants and travel, healthcare, and higher education. After working at Cal Poly as the Marketing Operations Manager for nearly three years, I went out on my own and started my digital marketing business, Katie Mae Marketing, LLC. I currently spend most of my time as the Digital Marketing Manager for my main client, Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, as well as the Marketing Manager for Tech Ladies – and I do it all remotely!

Here’s why I’d make a great Digital Marketing Manager for GitHub: 

•	With 6+ years experience as a marketing manager in a variety of industries, I’m able to bring a diverse perspective that can only be achieved through multi-industry experience.

•	At Kimpton, I currently work with regional directors to develop strategic data-driven plans that directly increase revenue and effectively reach our target audience.

•	This past year, I managed paid search and social advertising campaigns with a budget of $200,000 that yielded a 150% ROI.

•	In my recent website redesign project of over 30 websites, I worked directly with developers create sites that were optimized for reservation conversions and met the goals of stakeholders, all while managing the project budget.

•	Each month, I develop “deep-dives” for four different area in the US that includes assessments of current KPIs and actionable recommendations and budget forecasts on how to improve.

•	I recently developed a POV for every paid digital platform available, including best practices, budget recommendations, and targeting recommendations.

•	On my team, I manage eight co-workers with whom I am in constant contact with every day through digital collaboration tools. I have a great relationship with all my co-workers, and feel my strong interpersonal skills are to thank for that.

•	I’ve been a remote worker for over two years, and I LOVE IT. I truly think that people can do their best work when they’re able to work from where they want (as long as there is strong Wifi!) ☺ 


A remote mindset and a love for travel typically go hand-in-hand, and there’s no exception with me. I love eating my way through new cities, hiking, camping, fishing, and of course, fluffy, lovable dogs.

I would be honored to have the opportunity to speak with your team about this role and how my skills and experience can significantly contribute to GitHub’s growth. Please feel free to contact me by email at katiemaecolombo@gmail.com, or give me a ring at 530-517-1520. I truly look forward to hearing from you.


All the best,

Katelyn Peters

P.S. Colombo is my maiden name, hence the last name in my email ☺
